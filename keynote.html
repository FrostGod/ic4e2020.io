Carlos A. Coello Coello received a PhD in Computer Science from Tulane University (USA) in 1996. He is currently full professor with distinction (Investigador Cinvestav 3F) at CINVESTAV-IPN in Mexico City, Mexico. Dr. Coello has done pioneering research work in an area which is now known as "evolutionary multi-objective optimization", mainly related to the development of new algorithms. For example, he developed the first micro genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization and the first Pareto-based multi-objective artificial immune system. He has published over 480 papers in international peer-reviewed journals, book chapters, and conferences. He has also co-authored the book "Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi-Objective Problems", which is now in its Second Edition (Springer, 2007) and has co-edited the book "Applications of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms" (World Scientific, 2004). His publications currently report over 46,000 citations, according tr 18o Google Scholar (his h-index is 83). He received the 2007 National Research Award (granted by the Mexican Academy of Science) in the area of exact sciences and, since January 2011, he is an IEEE Fellow for "contributions to multi-objective optimization and constraint-handling techniques." He is also the recipient of the prestigious 2013 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award , of the 2012 National Medal of Science and Arts in the area of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences (this is the highest award that a scientist can receive in Mexico) and of the 2016 TWAS Award in Enginering Sciences. He also serves as associate editor of several journals including IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, Computational Optimization and Applications, Pattern Analysis and Applications, Journal of Heuristics, Evolutionary Computation and Applied Soft Computing. He was also the General Chair of the 2013 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, which took place in Canc√∫n, Mexico. He is currently Vice president for Member Activities of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.
